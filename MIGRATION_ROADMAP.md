# üèãÔ∏è PPL Workout App - Migration Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the migration path from the current simplified architecture to the advanced, production-ready architecture shown in the database and workflow diagrams.

## Current State Analysis ‚úÖ

### Database Schema (Working) - Version 7

- [x] **workout_days** table: Stores daily workout sessions ‚úÖ
- [x] **workout_entries** table: Links exercises to workout days ‚úÖ
- [x] **set_entries** table: Individual set tracking with timing ‚úÖ
- [x] **workout_templates** table: Template definitions for reusable workouts ‚úÖ
- [x] **template_exercises** table: Junction table linking templates to exercises ‚úÖ

### Features Working ‚úÖ
- [x] PPL workout creation based on day of week
- [x] **Template-based workout creation system** ‚úÖ
- [x] Exercise detail screens with set progression
- [x] Individual set timing and completion tracking
- [x] Cross-exercise contamination fixed (sets isolated per exercise)
- [x] Database reset functionality for development
- [x] Timer functionality with start/stop per set
- [x] Enhanced exercise library with rich metadata (34+ exercises)
- [x] Automatic template population on database creation
- [x] Template selection and creation methods

### Current Architecture Status
- **Exercise Library**: Rich metadata with 34+ exercises in `ExerciseData.getPPLExercises()` ‚úÖ
- **Template System**: Complete entities, DAOs, and repository methods ‚úÖ
- **Workout Logic**: **Both day-based AND template-based systems working** ‚úÖ
- **Database Version**: 7 (with complete template system migration)
- **UI Layer**: Daily workout screens with template integration ‚úÖ

- [x] **1.1.2** Created database migration (Version 5 ‚Üí 6) ‚úÖ
- [x] **1.1.3** Updated exercise data with rich metadata ‚úÖ

### 1.2 Create Workout Templates System ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **1.2.1** Created WorkoutTemplate entity ‚úÖ
- [x] **1.2.2** Created TemplateExercise junction entity ‚úÖ
- [x] **1.2.3** Created corresponding DAOs (WorkoutTemplateDao, TemplateExerciseDao) ‚úÖ
- [x] **1.2.4** Updated database schema (Version 6 ‚Üí 7) ‚úÖ
- [x] **1.2.5** Created PPL template data with 6 predefined templates ‚úÖ

### 1.3 Implement Template-Based Workout Creation ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Replace current day-based workout creation with template selection

#### Tasks:
- [x] **1.3.1** Update Repository to use templates ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  ```kotlin
  suspend fun createWorkoutFromTemplate(templateId: Int, date: String): List<WorkoutEntry>
  suspend fun createTodaysWorkoutFromTemplate(): Flow<List<WorkoutEntryWithExercise>>
  fun getAvailableTemplates(): Flow<List<WorkoutTemplate>>
  fun getTemplatesByCategory(category: String): Flow<List<WorkoutTemplate>>
  ```

- [x] **1.3.2** Populate templates in database on first run ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - Created PPLTemplateData.kt with 6 predefined PPL workout templates
  - Added template-exercise relationships with proper sets, reps, and rest periods
  - Includes helper functions for day-based compatibility
  - Auto-population on database creation

- [x] **1.3.3** Update ViewModel to use template-based creation ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - Added `createWorkoutFromTemplate(templateId: Int, date: String)` method
  - Integrated template selection logic
  - Maintains backward compatibility with day-based creation

- [x] **1.3.4** Migrate from day-based to template-based workout creation ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - Both systems working in parallel
  - Template-based system handles PPL schedule automatically
  - Legacy day-based methods preserved for compatibility

- [ ] **1.3.5** Update UI to show template selection (optional for phase 1) ‚≠ê **NEXT PRIORITY**
  - Current UI uses automatic template selection based on day
