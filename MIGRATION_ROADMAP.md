# 🏋️ PPL Workout App - Migration Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the migration path from the current simplified architecture to the advanced, production-ready architecture shown in the database and workflow diagrams.

## Current State Analysis ✅

### Database Schema (Working)
- [x] **exercises** table: Enhanced with rich metadata (primaryMuscle, secondaryMuscles, equipment, difficulty, instructions, tips, category) ✅
- [x] **workout_days** table: Stores daily workout sessions ✅
- [x] **workout_entries** table: Links exercises to workout days ✅
- [x] **set_entries** table: Individual set tracking with timing ✅
- [x] **workout_templates** table: Template definitions for reusable workouts ✅
- [x] **template_exercises** table: Junction table linking templates to exercises ✅

### Features Working
- [x] PPL workout creation based on day of week
- [x] Exercise detail screens with set progression
- [x] Individual set timing and completion tracking
- [x] Cross-exercise contamination fixed
- [x] Database reset functionality for development
- [x] Timer functionality with start/stop per set
- [x] Enhanced exercise library with rich metadata

### Current Architecture
- **Exercise Library**: Rich metadata with 34+ exercises in `ExerciseData.getPPLExercises()` ✅
- **Template System**: Complete entities and DAOs created ✅
- **Workout Logic**: Day-based (to be migrated to template-based)
- **Database Version**: 7 (with template system migration)

## Week 1 Sprint 1 - Completed Features 🎯

### ✅ Enhanced Exercise Entity
- **Before**: Simple Exercise entity with only `id`, `name`, `isCompound`
- **After**: Rich Exercise entity with 8 additional fields:
  - `primaryMuscle`: Main muscle group targeted
  - `secondaryMuscles`: Secondary muscles (comma separated)
  - `equipment`: Required equipment type
  - `difficulty`: Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced
  - `instructions`: Step-by-step exercise guide
  - `tips`: Form tips and common mistakes
  - `category`: Push/Pull/Legs classification

### ✅ Database Migration v5 → v6
- **Migration**: Properly implemented Room database migration
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing data preserved during migration
- **New Columns**: All new fields added with appropriate defaults
- **Build Status**: ✅ Build successful, no compilation errors

### ✅ Rich Exercise Data Library
- **New File**: Created `ExerciseData.kt` with comprehensive metadata
- **All 34 Exercises**: Each exercise now includes:
  - Detailed step-by-step instructions
  - Form tips and safety advice
  - Muscle group classifications
  - Equipment requirements
  - Difficulty levels
- **Database Integration**: Database now uses the enhanced exercise data

## Next Steps - Week 2 Sprint 2 🚀
Ready to start **Sprint 2** with workout templates system:
1. Create `WorkoutTemplate` entity for flexible workout creation
2. Create `TemplateExercise` junction table for template-exercise relationships
3. Build corresponding DAOs for the new entities
