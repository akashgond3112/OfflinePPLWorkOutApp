### 1.3 Implement Template-Based Workout Creation ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Replace current day-based workout creation with template selection

#### Tasks:
- [x] **1.3.1** Update Repository to use templates ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  ```kotlin
  suspend fun createWorkoutFromTemplate(templateId: Int, date: String): List<WorkoutEntry>
  suspend fun createTodaysWorkoutFromTemplate(): Flow<List<WorkoutEntryWithExercise>>
  fun getAvailableTemplates(): Flow<List<WorkoutTemplate>>
  fun getTemplatesByCategory(category: String): Flow<List<WorkoutTemplate>>
  ```

- [x] **1.3.2** Populate templates in database on first run ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - Created PPLTemplateData.kt with 6 predefined PPL workout templates
  - Added template-exercise relationships with proper sets, reps, and rest periods
  - Includes helper functions for day-based compatibility
  - Auto-population on database creation

- [x] **1.3.3** Update ViewModel to use template-based creation ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - Added `createWorkoutFromTemplate(templateId: Int, date: String)` method
  - Integrated template selection logic
  - Maintains backward compatibility with day-based creation

- [x] **1.3.4** Migrate from day-based to template-based workout creation ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - Both systems working in parallel
  - Template-based system handles PPL schedule automatically
  - Legacy day-based methods preserved for compatibility

- [x] **1.3.5** Update UI to show template selection ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - Created comprehensive TemplateSelectionScreen with Material 3 design
  - Added template cards with category colors (Push/Pull/Legs)

    - "Choose Different Workout" (manual template selection)
  - Implemented seamless navigation between screens
  - Template metadata display (duration, exercise count, last used date)
  - Added "Change Template" button to exercise list screen for easy access

### 1.4 Rest Timer Between Sets üöÄ **NEXT PRIORITY**
**Goal**: Add automatic rest timer functionality to improve workout flow and timing accuracy

#### Tasks:
- [x] **1.4.1** Add rest timer UI component to ExerciseDetailScreen
  - Position timer at top of screen with "Rest" label
  - Use same visual design as set timers for consistency
  - Show countdown format (e.g., "Rest: 02:30" counting down)

- [] **1.4.2** Implement rest timer logic in ExerciseDetailViewModel
  - Start rest timer automatically when user completes a set
  - Stop rest timer when user starts next set
  - Add rest time to total exercise time calculation
  - Reset rest timer to 0 when next set begins

- [ ] **1.4.3** Update total time calculation to include rest periods
  - Total time = completed set times + rest period times
  - Ensure rest time is added to database for accurate tracking
  - Update UI display to reflect total workout time including rest

- [ ] **1.4.4** Add rest timer configuration
  - Default rest periods based on exercise type (e.g., 90s for compounds, 60s for accessories)
  - Allow manual rest timer adjustment (optional future enhancement)
  - Rest timer visual feedback (color changes, progress indicators)

- [ ] **1.4.5** Enhance workout flow with rest timer
  - Visual indication when rest period is complete
  - Optional notification/vibration when rest is over
  - Smooth transition from rest timer to next set timer

**User Flow Enhancement**:
1. User completes Set 1 ‚Üí Rest timer starts automatically (e.g., 90 seconds)
2. Rest timer counts up: "Rest: 00:30", "Rest: 01:00", "Rest: 01:30"...
3. User starts Set 2 ‚Üí Rest timer stops, rest time added to total time, timer resets to 0
4. Process repeats for each set completion

**Benefits**:
- Accurate total workout time tracking (including rest periods)
- Better workout pacing and consistency
- Professional gym timer experience
- Improved workout data for analytics

## üî• **HOTFIX SECTION - Critical Usability Issues**

Before proceeding to Phase 2, we need to address critical usability issues identified during Phase 1 testing:

### HF.1 Exercise Detail Screen UX Issues ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **HF.1.1** Remove confusing "Mark as Done" button - simplify to Start/Stop workflow ‚úÖ
- [x] **HF.1.2** Implement proper Start ‚Üí Stop ‚Üí Complete workflow for sets ‚úÖ
  - User clicks "Start" ‚Üí Timer begins, button becomes "Complete Set"
  - User clicks "Complete Set" ‚Üí Timer stops, set marked as completed automatically
  - No separate "Mark as Done" button needed

### HF.2 WorkoutTimer Implementation Issues ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**  
- [x] **HF.2.1** Fix timer display format to proper HH:MM:SS format ‚úÖ
- [x] **HF.2.2** Fix timer counting logic (was accelerating: 1s‚Üí3s‚Üí6s‚Üí10s) ‚úÖ
- [x] **HF.2.3** Ensure proper second-by-second counting (00:00:01, 00:00:02, etc.) ‚úÖ
- [x] **HF.2.4** Test timer accuracy and visual updates ‚úÖ
- [x] **HF.2.5** Fix ExerciseDetailScreen timer display (was showing 42:13:20 instead of 02:32) ‚úÖ
- [x] **HF.2.6** Fix total exercise time display (was showing 24:10:00 instead of 00:22) ‚úÖ
- [x] **HF.2.7** Fix total time live updates (should only update when sets complete, not during timer) ‚úÖ
- [x] **HF.2.8** Fix timer double-counting issue (30 seconds saved as 60 seconds in database) ‚úÖ

**Timer Fix Details:**
- Fixed timer acceleration: Removed double-addition in ViewModel (`timer.elapsedTime + calculated_time`)
- Fixed unit conversion: Added milliseconds to seconds conversion in UI (`totalExerciseTime / 1000`)
- Fixed total time behavior: Total now only includes completed sets, not running timers
- Fixed double-counting: Removed duplicate elapsed time calculation in `stopSetTimer()`
- Timer now works like proper stopwatch: 1s ‚Üí 2s ‚Üí 3s ‚Üí 4s (linear counting)
- Total time displays correctly: 22 seconds = `00:22`, not `06:06:40`
- Live timer and stored database values now match exactly

### HF.3 Set Progression Flow ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **HF.3.1** Simplify set completion to single Start/Stop action ‚úÖ
- [x] **HF.3.2** Remove redundant UI elements that confuse the workflow ‚úÖ
- [x] **HF.3.3** Ensure clean progression: Start Set ‚Üí Complete Set ‚Üí Next Set ‚úÖ

**Priority**: These hotfixes must be completed before Phase 2 to ensure good user experience foundation.
